# Glovo Delivery Optimization

An end-to-end delivery optimization platform built with Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Streamlit. The project analyses 50,000 Glovo delivery orders to uncover operational inefficiencies, predict delays, optimise courier staffing, estimate environmental impact, and surface customer feedback insights — all through an interactive six-page dashboard.

- `pip` or a virtual environment manager

### Installation

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
# Ensure data/orders_details.csv is present, then:

## Source Modules (`src/`)

### 1. `preprocessing.py` — Data Loading, Cleaning & Feature Engineering

This module is the entry point of the data pipeline. It transforms the raw CSV into a clean, feature-rich DataFrame ready for analysis and modelling.

**Functions:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `load_data(filepath)` | Reads the CSV, drops unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 0`, `delivery_status_y`, `promised_time`, `actual_time`), renames ambiguous columns, and parses all datetime columns (`order_date`, `promised_delivery_time`, `actual_delivery_time`, `feedback_date`, `registration_date`). |
| `compute_features(df)` | Engineers new columns from the cleaned data. Creates temporal features (`hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, `is_peak_hour`, `month`), delay flags (`is_delayed`, `is_significantly_delayed`), `customer_lifetime_days` (days since registration), `profit_margin` (profit / order total), and `order_size_category` (Small < $500, Medium < $2000, Large). |
| `encode_categoricals(df)` | Label-encodes `payment_method`, `customer_segment`, `feedback_category`, and `sentiment` into `*_encoded` columns. Maps `delivery_status` to numeric values (On Time → 0, Slightly Delayed → 1, Significantly Delayed → 2). |
| `get_feature_matrix(df)` | Returns `(X, y)` for **regression**: X contains 14 feature columns, y is `delivery_time_minutes`. |
| `get_classification_matrix(df)` | Returns `(X, y)` for **binary classification**: X contains the same 14 features, y is `is_delayed` (0 or 1). |

**Feature Columns used for modelling (14 total):**
`order_total`, `number_product`, `total_quantity`, `distance_km`, `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, `is_peak_hour`, `month`, `payment_method_encoded`, `customer_segment_encoded`, `total_orders`, `avg_order_value`, `profit_margin`.

### 2. `model.py` — Machine Learning Training & Evaluation

This module handles the full ML lifecycle: training, evaluation, model selection, persistence, and prediction.

**Functions:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `train_regression_models(X_train, y_train)` | Trains three regression models — **Random Forest** (100 trees), **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM** — all with `random_state=42` for reproducibility. Returns a dictionary `{name: fitted_model}`. |
| `train_classification_models(X_train, y_train)` | Same as above but for binary classification (delay yes/no). Uses `RandomForestClassifier`, `XGBClassifier`, and `LGBMClassifier`. |
| `evaluate_regression(models, X_test, y_test)` | Computes **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R²** for each regression model on the test set. Returns a DataFrame indexed by model name. |
| `evaluate_classification(models, X_test, y_test)` | Computes **Accuracy**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC** for each classification model. |
| `save_best_model(models, metrics, path, metric_col)` | Selects the best model by the given metric (lowest RMSE/MAE or highest R²/Accuracy) and saves it to disk using `joblib`. Returns the winning model name. |
| `get_feature_importance(model, feature_names)` | Extracts `.feature_importances_` from the model and returns a sorted DataFrame showing which features contribute most to predictions. |
| `predict_delay(model, input_dict)` | Takes a dictionary of feature values, converts it to a DataFrame, runs `model.predict()`, and returns the predicted delivery delay in minutes. Used for real-time predictions in the dashboard. |

**How model selection works:**
The three models are trained on an 80/20 train-test split. The model with the lowest RMSE is automatically selected as the best, saved to `models/best_regression_model.pkl`, and used for all subsequent predictions. Training happens once at app startup via `@st.cache_resource` and is cached for the session.

### 3. `clustering.py` — Area Performance Analysis

This module groups orders by delivery area and computes aggregate performance metrics to identify problematic zones.

**Functions:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `compute_area_stats(df)` | Groups by `area` and computes: `order_count`, `avg_delivery_delay` (mean minutes), `delay_rate_pct` (% of late orders), `significant_delay_rate_pct` (% of significantly delayed), `avg_distance_km`, `avg_order_total`, `avg_rating`, `positive_sentiment_pct`. Sorted by delay rate descending. |
| `classify_area_performance(area_stats)` | Assigns a **performance tier** to each area: 🔴 **High Risk** (delay rate > 40%), 🟡 **Medium Risk** (20–40%), 🟢 **Low Risk** (< 20%). |
| `get_top_bottom_areas(area_stats, n)` | Returns the best and worst `n` areas by delay rate as two separate DataFrames. |
| `compute_hourly_patterns(df)` | Computes average delay and delay rate per hour of day across all areas. |
| `compute_segment_analysis(df)` | Computes average order value, rating, delay rate, and order count per customer segment (New, Regular, Premium, Inactive). |

---

### 4. `optimization.py` — Courier Load Balancing & Staffing

This module simulates courier workload distribution and recommends staffing adjustments to reduce delays during peak hours.

**Functions:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `compute_zone_performance(df)` | Groups by `area` (courier zone) and computes: total deliveries, average delay (minutes), on-time rate (%), average distance, average order total, and average rating. Sorted by on-time rate ascending. |
| `identify_overloaded_zones(zone_stats, threshold)` | Filters zones with on-time rate below the given threshold (default: 50%). |
| `simulate_load_redistribution(df)` | Identifies zones with above-average delay and simulates shifting 20% of their orders to lower-delay zones. Estimates the fleet-wide delay improvement. |
| `compute_peak_hour_analysis(df)` | Computes order count, average delay, unique couriers, and **utilization** (orders per courier) for each hour of the day. |
| `recommend_staffing(peak_df)` | Identifies the 5 most stressed hours using a **stress score** = utilization × average delay. Recommends extra couriers needed (assuming ≤ 10 orders per courier per hour) and estimates the expected delay reduction in minutes. |

**Redistribution logic:**
- Zones with above-average delay are identified as "high-delay zones".
- 20% of their order volume is simulated as redistributed to lower-delay zones.
- Redistributed orders are assumed to achieve the average delay of the low-delay zones.
- This is a heuristic simulation — real-world redistribution would require route-level optimisation.

### 5. `co2.py` — CO₂ Emission Estimation

This module estimates the carbon footprint of the delivery fleet based on distance travelled and vehicle type, and simulates electrification scenarios.

**Emission Factors (gCO₂ per km):**

| Vehicle | gCO₂/km |
|---------|---------|
| Motorcycle | 103 |
| Car | 171 |
| Electric Scooter | 22 |
| Bicycle | 0 |

**Functions:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `estimate_co2_per_order(distance_km, mode)` | Returns CO₂ emissions in grams for a single delivery. Default mode is motorcycle. |
| `compute_fleet_co2(df, mode)` | Computes total fleet emissions (kg), average per order (g), and total distance (km) assuming all deliveries use the specified mode. |
| `co2_scenario(df, pct_electric)` | Simulates switching a given percentage of the fleet from motorcycles to electric scooters. Randomly selects which orders are "electric" (seeded for reproducibility). Returns baseline CO₂, scenario CO₂, savings in kg, and savings percentage. |
| `co2_by_area(df)` | Computes total and average CO₂ per delivery area (assuming motorcycle). Sorted by total emissions descending. |
